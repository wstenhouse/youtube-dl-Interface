# youtube-dl-Interface
Little shell script that allows you to download an entire youtube user's page.

You'll need youtube-dl to run the script

You can use CURL to install it on UNIX (Linux, OS X, etc.), type:
```
sudo curl https://yt-dl.org/downloads/2016.02.01/youtube-dl -o /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl
sudo chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/youtube-dl
```

You can also use pip:
```
sudo pip install --upgrade youtube_dl
```

You can use Homebrew if you have it:
```
brew install youtube-dl
```
